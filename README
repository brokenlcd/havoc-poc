havoc-poc:

        This is the proof-of-concept code to verify the logic in the
        Arduino sketch for the Havoc OSRNG.

        Usage: havoc [-d]
                -d      Enter debug mode, with more output and 1s delay between
                        RBG samples.

        This should be tested on OpenBSD, which has two separate RNGs
        (/dev/arandom and /dev/urandom). On other operating systems, a
        single RNG defeats the purpose of the POC.
